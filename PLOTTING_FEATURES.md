# 📊 Time Series and Performance Plotting Features

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive time series and performance plotting system for the Kiwi Dairy Farm game. This system provides real-time visualization of all relevant game variables to help players track their farm's performance over time.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **PlotManager System** (`src/js/game/ui/PlotManager.js`)
- **Real-time data visualization** with multiple chart types (line, bar, area, step)
- **Interactive plot interface** with toggle visibility and tabbed organization
- **Responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Export functionality** for analytics data

### 2. **Enhanced StatisticsSystem** (`src/js/game/systems/StatisticsSystem.js`)
- **Comprehensive data collection** for all relevant game variables
- **Historical data storage** (up to 365 days of history)
- **Weather impact scoring** and environmental compliance tracking
- **Achievement and milestone progress tracking**

### 3. **Plot Categories and Metrics**

#### 📈 **Production Metrics**
- **Milk Production (L/day)** - Daily milk output from your herd
- **Milk Quality (%)** - Quality percentage of produced milk
- **Farm Efficiency (%)** - Overall operational efficiency score

#### 💰 **Financial Metrics**
- **Daily Income ($)** - Revenue from milk sales and other sources
- **Daily Expenses ($)** - Operating costs including feed, maintenance, etc.
- **Net Profit ($)** - Daily profit/loss with zero line indicator
- **Cash Flow ($)** - Total cash on hand over time

#### 🐄 **Cattle Metrics**
- **Cattle Count** - Total number of cattle over time
- **Average Cattle Health (%)** - Health status of your herd
- **Daily Feed Consumption (kg)** - Feed usage tracking

#### 🌱 **Environmental Metrics**
- **Environmental Compliance (%)** - Regulatory compliance score
- **Carbon Footprint (kg CO2/day)** - Environmental impact tracking
- **Water Usage (L/day)** - Daily water consumption

#### 🚜 **Operations Metrics**
- **Pasture Quality (%)** - Average pasture condition
- **Weather Impact Score** - Composite weather effect on operations

### 4. **Interactive Features**

#### 🎮 **User Controls**
- **Toggle Button**: Show/hide plots panel (📈 Show Plots button)
- **Time Range Selector**: View data for 7, 30, 90, or 365 days
- **Category Tabs**: Switch between Production, Financial, Cattle, Environment, and Operations
- **Export Function**: Download analytics data as JSON

#### ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- **P key**: Toggle plots visibility
- **S key**: Show statistics modal
- **Space**: Pause/resume game

#### 📱 **Responsive Design**
- **Desktop**: Two-column plot grid for optimal viewing
- **Mobile**: Single-column layout with swipe-friendly tabs
- **Adaptive sizing**: Plots automatically resize based on screen size

### 5. **Visual Design**

#### 🎨 **Chart Types**
- **Line Charts**: For continuous metrics (efficiency, health, quality)
- **Bar Charts**: For discrete daily values (income, expenses, consumption)
- **Area Charts**: For cumulative metrics (cash flow, carbon footprint)
- **Step Charts**: For discrete counts (cattle numbers)

#### 🎯 **Performance Indicators**
- **Target Lines**: Dashed lines showing optimal performance targets
- **Color Coding**: 
  - 🟢 Excellent (95%+ of target)
  - 🔵 Good (80-95% of target)
  - 🟡 Fair (60-80% of target)
  - 🔴 Poor (<60% of target)
- **Zero Lines**: For profit tracking (positive/negative indicators)

#### 📊 **Data Presentation**
- **Real-time Updates**: Plots refresh every second during gameplay
- **Smooth Animations**: Slide-in effects and hover interactions
- **Grid Lines**: For easy value reading
- **Axis Labels**: Clear labeling for time and value scales

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Architecture**
- **Modular Design**: Separate PlotManager class for maintainability
- **Canvas-based Rendering**: High-performance graphics using HTML5 Canvas
- **Event-driven Updates**: Efficient data synchronization with game systems
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old data points

### **Data Flow**
1. **Collection**: StatisticsSystem gathers data from all game systems
2. **Storage**: Daily statistics stored with 365-day rolling history
3. **Processing**: Analytics computed in real-time with weather scoring
4. **Visualization**: PlotManager renders data using Canvas API
5. **Export**: JSON export functionality for external analysis

### **Integration Points**
- **Game.js**: Main game loop includes PlotManager updates
- **UIManager**: Integrated plot controls in action panel
- **CSS**: Comprehensive styling in `src/css/plots.css`
- **HTML**: Analytics panel added to game interface

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### **Starting the Game**
1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Select "New Game" and choose a scenario
3. The game will load with all systems including plotting

### **Viewing Plots**
1. Click the **"📈 Show Plots"** button in the Analytics panel
2. Use the tabs to switch between different metric categories
3. Adjust the time range using the dropdown selector
4. Hover over data points for detailed information

### **Exporting Data**
1. Click **"💾 Export Data"** to download analytics as JSON
2. Use the exported data for external analysis or backup

### **Development/Testing**
- Use browser developer tools to access `window.game`
- Available cheat commands:
  - `game.cheat_addCash(10000)` - Add money
  - `game.cheat_addMilk(1000)` - Add milk
  - `game.cheat_skipTime(24)` - Skip 24 hours

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### **Efficient Rendering**
- **Canvas Reuse**: Single canvas per plot for memory efficiency
- **Selective Updates**: Only visible plots are rendered
- **Data Sampling**: Large datasets automatically sampled for performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Plot components loaded only when needed

### **Memory Management**
- **Rolling History**: Automatic cleanup of old data points
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized data structures for time series
- **Cache Management**: Smart caching of computed values

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

The plotting system is designed to be easily extensible. Potential future features:
